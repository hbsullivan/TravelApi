## Description

Practice Building an API with travel reviews.

Prompt: Build an API that allows users to GET and POST reviews about various travel destinations around the world. Here are some user stories to get started. Note that you will have to create custom endpoints for some of these user stories.

### Objectives (MVP) 

#### User Stories
* âœ… As a user, I want to GET and POST reviews about travel destinations.
* As a user, I want to GET reviews by country or city.
* As a user, I want to see the most popular travel destinations by number of reviews or by overall rating.
* As a user, I want to PUT and DELETE reviews, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)
* As a user, I want to look up random destinations just for fun.
